## Description
A website discussing good SEO practices. The code has good HTML semantics and intuitive easy-to-read CSS selectors. 

## Usage
The goal of the project is to show good semantics and organization within your HTML and CSS code. I did not alter the website at all but merely renamed the divs and selectors to be more user friendly for someone to understand the code.
